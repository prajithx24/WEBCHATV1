@limiter.limit("5/minute")
async def login(...):
    ...
```

  - Data permanently removed
  - Implementation needed

- [ ] **Data export**
  - User can download their data
  - Machine-readable format
  - Implementation needed

- [ ] **Privacy policy**
  - What data is collected
  - How it's used
  - How it's protected

### Other Regulations

- [ ] **Terms of Service**
- [ ] **Cookie policy** (if cookies used)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Risks

### Current Implementation

1. **Long-lived JWT tokens (7 days)**
   - Risk: Token theft = prolonged access
   - Mitigation: Implement refresh tokens
   - Priority: High for production

2. **No rate limiting**
   - Risk: Brute force attacks on auth
   - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting
   - Priority: High for production

3. **CORS open to all origins**
   - Risk: CSRF attacks
   - Mitigation: Restrict to production domain
   - Priority: Critical for production

4. **No message size limits**
   - Risk: DoS via large messages
   - Mitigation: Add size validation
   - Priority: Medium

5. **No account recovery**
   - Risk: Lost keys = lost access
   - Trade-off: Zero-knowledge vs. recovery
   - Decision: Acceptable for E2EE

### By Design

1. **No message recovery if key lost**
   - This is intentional for zero-knowledge
   - Users must backup their devices

2. **No server-side moderation**
   - Server cannot read messages
   - Client-side reporting needed

3. **No multi-device sync**
   - Private key on single device
   - Future: Key sharing protocol needed
